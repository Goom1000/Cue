## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-01)

**Core value:** Students see only the presentation; teachers see the teleprompter script
**Current focus:** v3.9 Delay Answer Reveal — Researching

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (researching)
Plan: —
Status: Researching pedagogical scaffolding patterns
Last activity: 2026-02-01 — Milestone v3.9 started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (researching)

## v3.9 Scope

**Goal:** AI-generated slides separate problems from answers, giving students thinking time with teacher-guided scaffolding in the teleprompter.

**Key decisions from questioning:**
- Applies to ALL examples with answers (math, comprehension, vocabulary, any concept)
- Answer reveal as separate component (next bullet on same slide)
- Teleprompter shows strategy steps + question prompts combined
- New generations only (no retrofit needed)
