# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-01)

**Core value:** Students see only the presentation; teachers see the teleprompter script
**Current focus:** v3.9 Delay Answer Reveal - Phase 52 Prompt Engineering Core

## Current Position

Phase: 52 of 54 (Prompt Engineering Core)
Plan: 2/? in phase (wave 2 complete)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-01 - Completed 52-02-PLAN.md (provider integration)

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50% (2/4 phases in v3.9)
Pending todos: 11 (one converted to milestone)

## v3.9 Scope

**Goal:** AI-generated slides separate problems from answers, giving students thinking time with teacher-guided scaffolding in the teleprompter.

**Phases:**
- Phase 51: Detection Foundation (DET-01 through DET-04) - COMPLETE
- Phase 52: Prompt Engineering Core (RST-01 through RST-04, SCF-01 through SCF-03) - IN PROGRESS
- Phase 53: Scaffolding Templates (SCF-04, SCF-05)
- Phase 54: Quality Assurance (QUA-01 through QUA-03)

**Key decisions from questioning:**
- Applies to ALL examples with answers (math, comprehension, vocabulary, any concept)
- Answer reveal as separate component (next bullet on same slide)
- Teleprompter shows strategy steps + question prompts combined
- New generations only (no retrofit needed)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Milestones shipped: 19 (v1.0 through v3.8)
- Total phases completed: 51
- Total plans completed: 156
- Total LOC: ~26,700 TypeScript
