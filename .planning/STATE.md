## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

### Pending Todos

See `.planning/todos/pending/` - run `/gsd:check-todos` to review.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase detection regex needs validation against real Australian lesson plan templates (research flag from SUMMARY)
- PPTX edge cases (SmartArt, charts, grouped shapes) may not extract cleanly -- needs testing with real teacher files
