# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-01)

**Core value:** Students see only the presentation; teachers see the teleprompter script
**Current focus:** v3.9 Delay Answer Reveal - Phase 54 Quality Assurance IN PROGRESS

## Current Position

Phase: 54 of 54 (Quality Assurance) - IN PROGRESS
Plan: 1/3 complete (54-03 provider parity validation done)
Status: Executing Phase 54 plans
Last activity: 2026-02-01 - Completed 54-03-PLAN.md

Progress: [████████░░] 80% (3.25/4 phases in v3.9)
Pending todos: 11 (one converted to milestone)

## v3.9 Scope

**Goal:** AI-generated slides separate problems from answers, giving students thinking time with teacher-guided scaffolding in the teleprompter.

**Phases:**
- Phase 51: Detection Foundation (DET-01 through DET-04) - COMPLETE
- Phase 52: Prompt Engineering Core (RST-01 through RST-04, SCF-01 through SCF-03) - COMPLETE
- Phase 53: Scaffolding Templates (SCF-04, SCF-05) - COMPLETE
- Phase 54: Quality Assurance (QUA-01 through QUA-03) - IN PROGRESS (1/3 plans)

**Key decisions from questioning:**
- Applies to ALL examples with answers (math, comprehension, vocabulary, any concept)
- Answer reveal as separate component (next bullet on same slide)
- Teleprompter shows strategy steps + question prompts combined
- New generations only (no retrofit needed)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Milestones shipped: 19 (v1.0 through v3.8)
- Total phases completed: 53
- Total plans completed: 158
- Total LOC: ~27,400 TypeScript

**Recent Milestones:**
- v3.8: 3 phases, 7 plans, 14 days (2026-02-01) - Preserve Teacher Content

- v3.5: 3 phases, 4 plans, 1 day (2026-01-27) - Working Wall Export

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**Recent (Phase 54-03):**
- Test approach: Source code pattern analysis rather than runtime mocking
- Provider parity validated via structural equivalence verification

### Pending Todos

See `.planning/todos/pending/` - run `/gsd:check-todos` to review

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
