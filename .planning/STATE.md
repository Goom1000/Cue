# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-01)

**Core value:** Students see only the presentation; teachers see the teleprompter script
**Current focus:** v3.9 Delay Answer Reveal - Phase 51 Detection Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 51 of 54 (Detection Foundation) - COMPLETE
Plan: 2/2 complete
Status: Phase complete, verified
Last activity: 2026-02-01 - Phase 51 verified (4/4 requirements)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 25% (1/4 phases in v3.9)
Pending todos: 11 (one converted to milestone)

## v3.9 Scope

**Goal:** AI-generated slides separate problems from answers, giving students thinking time with teacher-guided scaffolding in the teleprompter.

**Phases:**
- Phase 51: Detection Foundation (DET-01 through DET-04)
- Phase 52: Prompt Engineering Core (RST-01 through RST-04, SCF-01 through SCF-03)
- Phase 53: Scaffolding Templates (SCF-04, SCF-05)
- Phase 54: Quality Assurance (QUA-01 through QUA-03)

**Key decisions from questioning:**
- Applies to ALL examples with answers (math, comprehension, vocabulary, any concept)
- Answer reveal as separate component (next bullet on same slide)
- Teleprompter shows strategy steps + question prompts combined
- New generations only (no retrofit needed)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Milestones shipped: 19 (v1.0 through v3.8)
- Total phases completed: 51
- Total plans completed: 154
- Total LOC: ~26,700 TypeScript

**Recent Milestones:**
- v3.8: 3 phases, 7 plans, 14 days (2026-02-01) - Preserve Teacher Content
- v3.7: 6 phases, 12 plans, 3 days (2026-01-31) - AI Resource Enhancement
