## v4.0 Requirements

Requirements for Clipboard Builder milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Clipboard Paste

- [x] **CLIP-01**: User can paste slide content from PowerPoint via Ctrl+V/Cmd+V
- [x] **CLIP-02**: AI analyzes pasted content and generates improved Cue-style slide
- [x] **CLIP-03**: User can paste into specific position in deck (not just append)
- [x] **CLIP-04**: Visual loading indicator shows during paste processing
- [x] **CLIP-05**: "Paste Slide" button available for discoverability
- [x] **CLIP-06**: Before/after comparison shows what AI changed from pasted content

### Image Handling

- [x] **IMG-01**: User can paste images from clipboard (screenshots, copied images)
- [x] **IMG-02**: "Full Image" layout option in tile selector (image only, no text)
- [x] **IMG-03**: Pasted image displays as slide background/full bleed
- [x] **IMG-04**: User can drag-drop images onto existing slides
- [x] **IMG-05**: AI can generate caption for pasted/dropped images

### Deck Cohesion

- [x] **COHE-01**: "Make Cohesive" button available in editor toolbar — *Superseded by COND-01 (Condense Deck button)*
- [x] **COHE-02**: AI analyzes entire deck for tone and flow consistency — *Superseded by COND-02 (lesson-plan-aware analysis)*
- [x] **COHE-03**: Preview panel shows proposed changes before applying — *Superseded by COND-03 (CondensationPreview modal)*
- [x] **COHE-04**: User can apply or cancel cohesion changes — *Superseded by COND-04 (apply condensation with edit/remove/merge)*

### Gap Analysis

- [x] **GAP-01**: User can upload lesson plan PDF after deck is built
- [x] **GAP-02**: AI compares deck content against lesson plan
- [x] **GAP-03**: Gap list shows missing topics/content from lesson plan
- [x] **GAP-04**: Each gap has severity ranking (critical, recommended, nice-to-have)
- [x] **GAP-05**: AI suggests slide content for each identified gap
- [x] **GAP-06**: One-click button generates suggested slide from gap

### Deck Condensation (Added Phase 60)

- [x] **COND-01**: Condense Deck button requires lesson plan PDF upload (or reuses gap analysis plan if available)
- [x] **COND-02**: AI compares deck against lesson plan and proposes per-slide actions: keep, edit, remove, or merge
- [x] **COND-03**: Preview shows all slides with action badges and "N slides -> M slides" condensation stats
- [x] **COND-04**: Applying condensation edits content, removes redundant slides, and merges related slides
- [x] **COND-05**: Lesson plan defines what is essential — content coverage preserved while reducing slide count

## Future Requirements (Deferred)

- **COHE-05**: Highlight which specific slides will change in preview
- **COHE-06**: Per-slide accept/reject for cohesion suggestions
- **INT-01**: Paste multiple slides at once from PowerPoint
- **INT-02**: Preserve animations/transitions from pasted content

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Auto-monitor clipboard in background | Privacy concern, unexpected behavior |
| Paste .pptx files directly | That's file upload, not clipboard paste |
| Real-time collaborative editing | Complexity, no backend |
| Undo/redo history for cohesion | Adds significant state complexity |
| Video paste support | Storage/bandwidth concerns |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| CLIP-01 | 55 | Complete |
| CLIP-02 | 56 | Complete |
| CLIP-03 | 55 | Complete |
| CLIP-04 | 55 | Complete |
| CLIP-05 | 55 | Complete |
| CLIP-06 | 56 | Complete |
| IMG-01 | 57 | Complete |
| IMG-02 | 57 | Complete |
| IMG-03 | 57 | Complete |
| IMG-04 | 57 | Complete |
| IMG-05 | 57 | Complete |
| COHE-01 | 58->60 | Complete (Superseded by COND-01) |
| COHE-02 | 58->60 | Complete (Superseded by COND-02) |
| COHE-03 | 58->60 | Complete (Superseded by COND-03) |
| COHE-04 | 58->60 | Complete (Superseded by COND-04) |
| GAP-01 | 59 | Complete |
| GAP-02 | 59 | Complete |
| GAP-03 | 59 | Complete |

| COND-02 | 60 | Complete |
| COND-03 | 60 | Complete |
| COND-04 | 60 | Complete |
| COND-05 | 60 | Complete |
