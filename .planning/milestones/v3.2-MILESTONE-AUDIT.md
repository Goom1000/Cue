# Milestone v3.2 Audit Report: Pedagogical Slide Types

**Audited:** 2026-01-25T15:00:00Z
**Status:** PASSED
**Milestone Goal:** Extend Cue's pedagogical capabilities with AI-generated Elaborate/Work Together slides, live Class Challenge input, and single-slide script regeneration.

## Executive Summary

All 17 requirements satisfied. All 4 phases verified and passing. All 4 E2E flows complete. Cross-phase integration fully wired with 19 exports connected. Minimal tech debt (1 orphaned function documented as beyond-scope feature).

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Description | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| REGEN-01 | User can regenerate teleprompter script for single slide | 29 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| REGEN-02 | Regeneration respects current verbosity level | 29 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| REGEN-03 | Regeneration uses full slide context for coherent script | 29 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| ELAB-01 | User can insert Elaborate slide via "+" menu option | 30 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| ELAB-02 | AI generates 3-5 paragraphs expanding on current slide | 30 | ✓ SATISFIED |

| WORK-02 | AI generates collaborative activity for pairs (with group-of-3 alt) | 31 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| WORK-03 | Activity uses only basic classroom resources | 31 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| WORK-04 | Teleprompter shows facilitation notes for teacher | 31 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| CHAL-01 | User can insert Class Challenge slide via "+" menu option | 32 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| CHAL-02 | Slide displays editable prompt/question at top | 32 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| CHAL-03 | Teacher can input student contributions during presentation | 32 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| CHAL-04 | Contributions display as styled cards on slide | 32 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| CHAL-05 | Contributions sync to student view in real-time | 32 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| CHAL-06 | Contributions lock when navigating away from slide | 32 | ✓ SATISFIED |

**Score:** 17/17 requirements satisfied

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Name | Plans | Status | Verified |
|-------|------|-------|--------|----------|
| 29 | Single Teleprompter Regeneration | 1/1 | PASSED | 2026-01-25T08:30:00Z |
| 30 | Elaborate Slide Insertion | 1/1 | PASSED | 2026-01-25T00:49:01Z |
| 31 | Work Together Slide Insertion | 1/1 | PASSED | 2026-01-25T03:30:00Z |
| 32 | Class Challenge Interactive Slides | 1/1 | PASSED | 2026-01-25T14:30:00Z |

**Score:** 4/4 phases verified and passing

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Elaborate: Insert → teleprompter shows script → student view shows content | ✓ COMPLETE |
| 2 | Work Together: Insert → pairs generated → teleprompter shows notes → student view shows activity | ✓ COMPLETE |
| 3 | Class Challenge: Insert → input contributions → real-time sync to student view | ✓ COMPLETE |
| 4 | Regeneration: Works across all slide types respecting verbosity | ✓ COMPLETE |

**Score:** 4/4 flows complete

## Cross-Phase Integration

### Wiring Summary

| Category | Connected | Orphaned | Missing |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| API Methods | 4/4 | 0 | 0 |
| Handlers | 8/8 | 1* | 0 |
| UI Buttons | 4/4 | 0 | 0 |
| Layout Components | 2/2 | 0 | 0 |
| Sync Messages | 1/1 | 0 | 0 |

*handleShufflePairs orphaned by design (beyond requirements)

### Integration Points Verified

1. **Slide Type System**: All 3 new types (elaborate, work-together, class-challenge) extend Slide interface with backward-compatible optional fields
2. **SlideContentRenderer**: Switch handles all layouts with exhaustive cases + default fallback
3. **BroadcastChannel Sync**: STATE_UPDATE broadcasts full slides array including new fields (pairs, contributions, challengePrompt)
4. **Verbosity System**: Layout-agnostic regeneration via shared speakerNotes field

**Score:** 19/19 exports properly connected

## Tech Debt

### Phase 31: Work Together Slide Insertion

| Item | Severity | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| `handleShufflePairs` function exists (App.tsx:672) but not wired to UI | Low | None - pairs generated correctly on insertion, reshuffle is future enhancement |

**Note:** This was documented in Phase 31 VERIFICATION.md as "beyond requirements" - all 4 formal requirements (WORK-01 through WORK-04) are satisfied.

**Total:** 1 item across 1 phase (non-blocking)

## Anti-Patterns Found

None detected across all 4 phases:
- No TODO/FIXME comments in new code
- No stub patterns or placeholder implementations
- No console.log-only handlers
- TypeScript compiles without errors

## Human Verification Tests

Recommended acceptance tests for final sign-off:

1. **Elaborate Slide Quality**: Generate 2-3 Elaborate slides, verify analogies present, content doesn't repeat earlier slides
2. **Work Together Resource Compliance**: Generate activities, verify only pen/paper/whiteboard used
3. **Class Challenge Real-Time Sync**: Open student window, add contributions, verify cards appear instantly
4. **Regeneration Context Coherence**: Regenerate mid-deck slide, verify script references surrounding slides naturally

## Conclusion

**Milestone v3.2 Pedagogical Slide Types: PASSED**

All success criteria met:
- ✓ 17/17 requirements satisfied
- ✓ 4/4 phases verified passing
- ✓ 4/4 E2E flows complete
- ✓ 19/19 cross-phase exports wired
- ✓ 0 critical gaps
- ✓ 1 low-severity tech debt item (documented, non-blocking)

The milestone is ready for completion and tagging.
