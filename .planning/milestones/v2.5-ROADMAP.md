## Phases

### Phase 19: Rebrand to Cue

**Goal**: Replace all PiPi branding with Cue across UI, file format, and GitHub repository.
**Depends on**: Phase 18 (v2.4 Targeted Questioning)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 19-01: UI branding + file format migration (BRAND-01 through BRAND-05, FILE-01 through FILE-03)
- [x] 19-02: Repository rename + deployment (REPO-01, REPO-02)

**Details:**

Plan 19-01 (UI Branding + File Format):
- Browser tab title, favicon, header, and landing page display "Cue"
- File saves use .cue extension
- File loads accept both .cue and .pipi (backward compatible)
- AI prompts reference "Cue-style"
- All TypeScript types renamed from PiPi* to Cue*

Plan 19-02 (Repository + Deployment):
- GitHub repository renamed from "PiPi" to "Cue"
- Vite base path updated from `/PiPi/` to `/Cue/`
- GitHub Pages deployment at https://goom1000.github.io/Cue/

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:** None (single-phase milestone)

**Key Decisions:**
- Maintain backward compatibility by accepting both .cue and .pipi file extensions
- Keep localStorage keys unchanged (pipi- prefix) to preserve user data
- Keep BroadcastChannel name unchanged for cross-window sync compatibility
- Repository name: "Cue" (simple, matches brand exactly)
- Favicon path kept as relative (./favicon.png) for Vite base path compatibility

**Issues Resolved:**
- None - clean rebrand with no blockers

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None - intentional preservation of internal identifiers for backward compatibility is not debt
