## E2E User Flows

### Flow 1: Teacher Launches Student Window ✓
Teacher enters presentation mode → PermissionExplainer shows (if applicable) → Launch button opens window → StudentView renders and syncs → ConnectionStatus shows "Connected"

### Flow 2: Slide Navigation Sync ✓
Teacher navigates slides → PresentationView broadcasts STATE_UPDATE → StudentView receives and updates → Both views synchronized

### Flow 3: Reconnection After Refresh ✓
Student window open → Teacher refreshes → BroadcastChannel reconnects → STATE_REQUEST/UPDATE handshake → Toast "Reconnected" → Green status

### Flow 4: Window Recovery ✓
Student window closes → Heartbeat times out (5s) → isConnected = false → Status "Disconnected" → Launch button re-enables

### Flow 5: Fallback Flow (Non-Chromium) ✓
Firefox/Safari detected OR permission denied → ManualPlacementGuide shows → User copies URL → Opens manually → Late-join sync works

## Tech Debt

**None.** All phases completed without deferred items or stub implementations.

No TODO, FIXME, or placeholder patterns found in any phase artifacts.

## Anti-Patterns Checked

| Pattern | Found |
|---------|-------|
| TODO comments | 0 |
| FIXME comments | 0 |
| Stub/placeholder code | 0 |
| Disabled functionality | 0 |
| Hard-coded secrets | 0 |

## Human Verification Recommended

The following tests require physical hardware or browser interaction:

1. **Multi-monitor auto-placement** - Requires external monitor + Chrome/Edge
2. **Firefox/Safari fallback** - Requires non-Chromium browser
3. **Permission denied flow** - Requires denying browser prompt
4. **Presenter remote** - Requires physical clicker or Page Up/Down keys
5. **Connection status visual** - Requires observing green/gray chip transitions

All automated verification at the code level passed. Human verification recommended before production deployment.
