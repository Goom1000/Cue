## Tech Debt

### Critical: None

### Minor Items

| Phase | Item | Severity | Impact |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| 20 | GameContainer missing assertNever default case | Low | TypeScript implicit narrowing works; explicit would be cleaner |
| 26 | Missing VERIFICATION.md | Low | Plans executed successfully; formal verification skipped |
| 26 | PlaceholderStudentView dead code | Low | Unused fallback component |
| All | The Chase disabled but code preserved | Low | Intentional per user preference; no maintenance burden |

### Recommendations

1. **Phase 26 Verification** (optional): Run formal gsd-verifier on Phase 26 to generate VERIFICATION.md
2. **assertNever cleanup** (optional): Add `default: return assertNever(state);` to GameContainer.tsx
3. **Dead code removal** (optional): Remove PlaceholderStudentView from StudentGameView.tsx
