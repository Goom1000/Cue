## E2E Flow Verification

### Flow 1: New User Flow ✓
User visits app → sees "Cue" branding → uploads PDF → generates slides → saves as .cue file

All 7 steps verified complete.

### Flow 2: Legacy File Flow ✓
User has .pipi file → drags onto app → loads successfully → can edit → saves as .cue

All 7 steps verified complete. Backward compatibility working.

### Flow 3: File Picker Flow ✓
User clicks Load → file picker shows .cue/.pipi filter → can select either format

All 5 steps verified complete.

### Flow 4: Deployment Flow ✓
User visits https://goom1000.github.io/Cue/ → app loads with all assets → no 404s

User verified deployment working. All assets load correctly.

## Tech Debt

**None accumulated.** This was a clean rebrand with no shortcuts or deferred items.

### Intentional Preservations (Not Tech Debt)

The following internal identifiers were intentionally preserved to maintain backward compatibility:

| Location | Reference | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| BroadcastChannel | `pipi-presentation` | Cross-window sync, users never see |
| localStorage keys | `pipi-class-bank`, `pipi-settings` | Preserves existing user data |
| package.json | `"name": "pipi"` | npm package name, not user-visible |

**Key Decision:** "Internal naming doesn't affect UX, and changing would break existing user data."

## Milestone Definition of Done

From ROADMAP.md:

| Criteria | Status |
|----------|--------|
| User sees "Cue" in header, browser tab, and landing page | ✓ MET |
| User can save presentations as `.cue` files | ✓ MET |
| User can load existing `.pipi` files without issues | ✓ MET |
| App is accessible at new GitHub Pages URL | ✓ MET |
| All references to "PiPi" eliminated from visible UI | ✓ MET |

## Conclusion

**Milestone v2.5 (Rebrand to Cue) is complete and ready for archival.**

- All requirements satisfied
- No critical gaps
- No tech debt
- All user flows working
- Deployment verified at https://goom1000.github.io/Cue/
