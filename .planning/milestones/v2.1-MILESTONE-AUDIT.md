## Tech Debt

No tech debt accumulated. Implementation is clean.

## Implementation Evolution Notes

Phase 7 branding approach evolved during implementation based on user feedback:

1. **Original plan:** Use logo.png image with mix-blend-mode
2. **Final approach:** Styled "PiPi" text (violet/amber) with whiteboard SVG icon
3. **Reason:** User preferred styled text aesthetic
4. **Impact:** Goal intent still achieved (no "L" icon or "LessonLens" text)

Additional enhancements beyond original scope:
- Landing page has illustrated whiteboard logo with large "PiPi" text
- Light mode background uses subtle violet tint
- Dark mode is now the default theme

These changes satisfy all success criteria while improving the overall experience.

## Conclusion

v2.1 milestone is **ready for completion**. All requirements satisfied, all phases verified, all integration points connected, all E2E flows working, no regressions detected, no tech debt accumulated.
