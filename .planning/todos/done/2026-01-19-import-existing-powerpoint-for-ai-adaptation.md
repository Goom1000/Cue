title: Import existing PowerPoint for AI adaptation

## Problem

Teachers have existing PowerPoint presentations that are good quality but may be too text-dense or don't fit the PiPi slide format well. Currently, the app only allows uploading a lesson PDF to generate fresh slides.

Teachers want to:
1. Upload an existing PowerPoint (as PDF) alongside or instead of a lesson PDF
2. Have the AI analyze what already exists and understand the teacher's style/preferences
3. Get the AI to refine and adapt the existing presentation to work with PiPi's format
4. Preserve the good parts while making it fit better (less text-dense, proper structure, etc.)

This would save time vs. starting from scratch when good content already exists.

## Solution

TBD — possibilities include:
- Add a second upload option on landing page: "Upload existing presentation (PDF)"
- AI analyzes both: lesson content PDF + existing presentation PDF
- AI output adapts/refines existing slides rather than generating from scratch
- Could extract text, images, and structure from the existing presentation
- Prompt engineering to tell AI "user likes this style, but refine for our format"
