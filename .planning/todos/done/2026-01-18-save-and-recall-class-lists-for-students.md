title: Save and recall class lists for students
area: ui
files: []
---

## Problem

Currently, teachers must add students to the name list one by one every time they use the app. This is repetitive and time-consuming, especially when teaching the same classes regularly.

Teachers need the ability to:
1. Add students as normal to build a name list
2. Save that list as a named "class" (e.g., "Year 5 Blue", "Period 3 Math")
3. Later, click a button like "Populate from saved class"
4. Select a saved class from a bank/list
5. Have all students from that class auto-populate the current session

This would create a "class bank" feature for quick recall of student groups.

## Solution

TBD — likely involves:
- Local storage or file-based persistence for class lists
- UI to save current list as a class (with naming dialog)
- UI to browse/select from saved classes
- Option to manage saved classes (rename, delete, edit)
