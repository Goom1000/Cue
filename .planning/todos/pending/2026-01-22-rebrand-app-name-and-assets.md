title: Rebrand app name and assets

  - TBD (logo, icon, file extensions)

## Problem

The current name "PiPi" sounds unprofessional and has received negative feedback. The name is perceived as too "kitty" and not suitable for an education app used by teachers.

The rebrand will require changes to:
- App name throughout the codebase
- Main logo/icon assets
- File extension (currently `.pipi` for save files)
- Any branding in the UI

## Solution

TBD - Needs a new name decision first, then:
1. Decide on new app name
2. Design/source new logo and icon
3. Update file extension to match new brand
4. Search and replace name references in code
5. Update any marketing materials or documentation
