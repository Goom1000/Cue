<objective>
Verify the complete image paste feature set through hands-on testing. All five IMG requirements must work end-to-end.

Purpose: Visual and functional verification cannot be automated — requires human interaction with clipboard, drag-drop, and AI generation.

Output: Verification that Phase 57 is complete.

  <what-built>
  Complete image paste feature set (Phase 57):
  - IMG-01: Paste images from clipboard (screenshots, copied images)
  - IMG-02: "Full Image" layout option with empty state placeholder
  - IMG-03: Pasted images display as slide background/full bleed
  - IMG-04: Drag-drop images onto existing slides
  - IMG-05: AI-generated caption with teaching talking points
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
  **Test 1: Screenshot paste (IMG-01, IMG-03)**
  1. Take a screenshot (Cmd+Shift+4 on Mac)
  2. Press Cmd+V in Cue
  3. Verify: New full-image slide appears with screenshot filling edge-to-edge
  4. Verify: Toast appears with "Replace current instead" option
  5. Verify: .cue file is not unusually large (compression working)

  **Test 2: Web image paste (IMG-01)**
  1. Right-click an image on a web page and select "Copy Image"
  2. Press Cmd+V in Cue
  3. Verify: New full-image slide appears (routes to image paste, not HTML parse)

  **Test 3: Full Image layout selector (IMG-02)**
  1. Create a slide (or use existing text slide)
  2. Change layout to "Full Image" in the layout dropdown
  3. Verify: Dashed placeholder appears with "Paste or drop an image" text
  4. Click the placeholder
  5. Verify: File picker opens; select an image; slide fills with image

  **Test 4: Drag-drop image (IMG-04)**
  1. Open Finder and locate any image file (PNG, JPEG, etc.)
  2. Drag the image file onto the Cue app window
  3. Verify: Active slide's image is replaced with the dropped image
  4. Verify: Toast confirms "Image dropped — replaced current slide"

  **Test 5: AI caption generation (IMG-05)**
  1. On any image slide, find the "Generate AI Notes" button
  2. Click it
  3. Verify: Loading state shows while AI processes
  4. Verify: Title updates to a descriptive title
  5. Verify: Speaker notes populate with caption + teaching talking points
  6. Verify: Notes are editable (modify text, save works)

  **Regression Test: PowerPoint paste**
  1. Copy a slide from PowerPoint
  2. Paste in Cue
  3. Verify: Goes through AI analysis flow (Phase 56), NOT the image-only flow
  4. Verify: PasteComparison panel appears with AI teleprompter notes

  **Regression Test: .cue file drag-drop**
  1. Drag a .cue file onto the app
  2. Verify: File opens normally (not treated as image drop)
