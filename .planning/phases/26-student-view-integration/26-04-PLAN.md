Review QuickQuizStudentView answer reveal styling:

Current code already has:
```typescript
const isDimmed = isAnswerRevealed && !isCorrect;
// ...
${isDimmed ? 'opacity-20 grayscale' : 'opacity-100'}
```

This already meets VIEW-02. Verify the dimming is sufficiently dramatic per CONTEXT.md:
- "Wrong options dim/gray out when correct answer is revealed - draws focus to correct one"

Current: opacity-20 grayscale
CONTEXT.md decision: dim/gray out

The current implementation is correct. Just verify:
1. Wrong answers get opacity-20 grayscale when revealed
2. Correct answer gets animate-flash-correct
3. The green checkmark overlay appears on correct answer

If opacity-20 is too dim (hard to read), consider opacity-30 for balance.
The current implementation matches the spec, no changes needed unless testing reveals issues.

Keep the existing implementation - it already satisfies VIEW-02.

  <name>Task 2: Verify Millionaire and The Chase answer reveal</name>

Review answer reveal styling in MillionaireStudentView and TheChaseStudentView:

**MillionaireStudentView:**
Check current implementation:
- Selected but not revealed: amber background
- Revealed correct: green with flash
- Revealed wrong (if selected): red with wrong-answer animation
- Eliminated (50:50): reduced opacity

Current code shows this is already implemented properly.
Verify the non-selected, non-correct options dim when revealed.

Looking at current code, after reveal:
- Correct gets green + flash
- Selected wrong gets red + wrong animation
- Other options: no dimming currently

Add dimming for non-selected, non-correct options when showResult:
```typescript
// For options that are not selected and not correct, dim them on reveal
const isNeutralWrong = showResult && !isCorrect && !isSelected;
// Add to className:
${isNeutralWrong ? 'opacity-30' : ''}
```

**TheChaseStudentView:**
Review each phase's answer handling:

Cash Builder:
```typescript
${showResult && !isCorrect && !isContestantAnswer ? 'opacity-40' : ''}
```
Already has dimming. Current opacity-40 is fine.

Head-to-Head:
```typescript
${showResult && !isCorrect && !isContestantAnswer && !isChaserAnswer ? 'opacity-30' : ''}
```
Already has dimming. Good.

Final Chase phases:
```typescript
${showResult && !isCorrect && !isAnswer ? 'opacity-30' : ''}
```
Already has dimming. Good.

All Chase phases already implement answer dimming correctly.
