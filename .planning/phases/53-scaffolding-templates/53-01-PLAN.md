<objective>
Add explicit word count constraints to scaffolding templates ensuring each individual prompt is verbally deliverable in under 20 words.

Purpose: SCF-05 requires scaffolding prompts to be speakable naturally by teachers. The current templates show combined examples (24-28 words total) but lack explicit per-prompt word count guidance. This causes AI to sometimes generate long scripts instead of brief questions.

Output: Updated teachableMomentRules.ts with:
- Each scaffolding template updated with CORRECT/WRONG word count examples
- New VERBAL_DELIVERABILITY section added to output
- Emphasis on question-only format for natural verbal delivery
</objective>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update scaffolding templates with word count constraints</name>
  <files>services/prompts/teachableMomentRules.ts</files>
  <action>
Update all 5 scaffolding template constants (MATH, VOCABULARY, COMPREHENSION, SCIENCE, GENERAL) to include:

1. Explicit "each under 20 words" constraint in the header
2. Simplified question type examples (4-8 words each)
3. CORRECT example showing individual questions with word counts
4. WRONG example showing combined script that's too long to speak naturally
5. Keep [PAUSE] timing cues between questions

Follow the patterns from 53-RESEARCH.md Code Examples section.

**Math template update** - replace verbose guidance with:
- Question types: Known/unknown ("What do we know?"), Process ("What's the first step?"), Visual ("Can we draw this?")
- CORRECT: "What do we know? [PAUSE] What are we finding? [PAUSE] Can we draw it?"
- WRONG: Combined script example

**Vocabulary template update** - replace verbose guidance with:
- Question types: Context ("Have you heard this word?"), Word parts ("Do you see parts you recognize?"), Real-world ("Where might you use this?")
- CORRECT: Short questions with word counts
- WRONG: Long combined statement

**Comprehension template update** - replace verbose guidance with:
- Question types: Evidence ("What clues from the text?"), Inference ("What can we figure out?"), Connection ("What do we already know?")
- CORRECT/WRONG examples

**Science template update** - same pattern:
- Question types: Observation ("What do you notice?"), Prediction ("What will happen?"), Connection ("Where do we see this?")
- CORRECT/WRONG examples

**General template update** - same pattern:
- Question types: Think ("What comes to mind?"), Share ("Talk to a partner"), Discuss ("What ideas do we have?")
- CORRECT/WRONG examples

Keep the critical note about vocabulary definitions not repeating the word.

Read teachableMomentRules.ts and confirm:
- Each template has "under 20 words" in header
- Each template has CORRECT/WRONG examples
- Individual question examples are 4-10 words each
- [PAUSE] markers present in all examples
- TypeScript compiles: `cd "/Users/ricky/Documents/App_Projects/Education Apps/DEV - Cue" && npx tsc --noEmit`

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add VERBAL_DELIVERABILITY section to output</name>
  <files>services/prompts/teachableMomentRules.ts</files>
  <action>
Add a new constant VERBAL_DELIVERABILITY_RULES and include it in the getTeachableMomentRules() output, positioned after the TELEPROMPTER SCAFFOLDING section.

Create constant:
```typescript
const VERBAL_DELIVERABILITY_RULES = `
== VERBAL DELIVERABILITY (CRITICAL) ==

Each scaffolding question must be speakable in under 20 words.
Teachers read these aloud - short questions are natural, long scripts are awkward.

WORD COUNT EXAMPLES:
- "What do we know?" (4 words) - GOOD
- "What's the first step?" (4 words) - GOOD
- "Can you find evidence in the text?" (7 words) - GOOD
- "What do you think the author is trying to convey through this particular passage?" (14 words) - ACCEPTABLE but wordy
- "Think about what specific evidence from the passage might support your answer to this comprehension question." (16 words) - TOO LONG

Generate 2-3 SHORT questions, NOT one long paragraph.
Separate each question with [PAUSE] for teacher wait time (3-5 seconds).
`;
```

Insert this section in the template literal returned by getTeachableMomentRules(), right after the scaffolding templates are included and before TELEPROMPTER CONFIRMATION.

Read teachableMomentRules.ts and confirm:
- VERBAL_DELIVERABILITY_RULES constant exists
- It's included in the getTeachableMomentRules() return template
- Word count examples show GOOD/ACCEPTABLE/TOO LONG ratings
- TypeScript compiles: `cd "/Users/ricky/Documents/App_Projects/Education Apps/DEV - Cue" && npx tsc --noEmit`

  <done>VERBAL_DELIVERABILITY section added to AI prompt output, reinforcing per-prompt word count constraint</done>

Phase verification checklist:
1. TypeScript compiles without errors
2. Each scaffolding template contains "under 20 words" constraint
3. Each template has CORRECT/WRONG examples with word counts
4. VERBAL_DELIVERABILITY section present in output
5. All [PAUSE] markers preserved
6. Vocabulary special note preserved (definition doesn't repeat word)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- SCF-05 addressed: Templates explicitly constrain each individual prompt to under 20 words
- Subject-specific scaffolding maintained: Math gets decomposition, vocabulary gets context, comprehension gets evidence
- AI receives clear guidance: CORRECT/WRONG examples prevent long scripts
- Natural verbal delivery: Question-only format emphasized throughout
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/53-scaffolding-templates/53-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
