# Fractions Introduction (Year 3)

## Hook

Today we are going to learn about sharing things equally. Fractions help us split things into fair parts.

## I Do

Let me show you how fractions work.

Ask students: What is half of 8?

Watch as I draw 8 circles and split them into 2 equal groups. Each group has 4 circles. So half of 8 is 4.

## We Do

Now let's try one together. Complete this on your whiteboard: draw 12 dots and circle half of them.

Count how many dots you circled. You should have 6. Great job!

## You Do

Now it's your turn. Work on the practice problems on your worksheet.

Half means splitting into 2 equal groups.
