# The Water Cycle (Year 4)

## Introduction

Water is all around us! Today we will learn how water moves in a big circle called the water cycle.

Ask: What happens to water when it gets very hot?

Question: Where do you think rain comes from?

## Evaporation

The sun heats up water in lakes, rivers, and oceans. The water turns into tiny drops in the air. This is called evaporation.

Ask students: How does water get into the air?

Note: This is the most important part of the water cycle!

## Condensation

When water in the air rises high up, it gets cold. The tiny drops join together to make clouds.

Ask: What are clouds made of?

Important: Clouds are not made of cotton! They are made of tiny water drops.

## Precipitation

When clouds get too heavy with water, the water falls back down. This is called precipitation.

Question: Why does it rain?

Ask the class: What other ways can water fall from the sky besides rain?

## Activities

List 3 places where you can find water in your home.

Discuss with your partner how water moves from the ocean to a cloud.

Compare the water cycle to making pasta. When water boils, steam rises up. When steam hits the cold lid, it turns back into water drops!
