# Reading Comprehension: Story Elements (Year 5)

## Introduction

Today we are learning about the key parts of a story. Every good story has characters, a setting, and a plot.

Isn't it amazing how stories can take us to new places?

## Understanding Characters

Characters are the people or animals in a story. The main character is who the story is mostly about.

Ask students: When you think about your favourite story, what is the main character like, what problems do they face, and how do those problems help us understand who they really are as a person?

## Understanding Setting

The setting is where and when a story takes place. It can be a real place or a made-up world.

## Understanding Plot

The plot is what happens in the story. It has a beginning, middle, and end.

Question: Why is the order of events important in a story?

## Story Analysis Activity

Complete this story analysis by first writing the name of the main character and listing three words that describe them, then drawing a picture of where the story takes place with the time period labeled, and finally putting the five main events in order from first to last on your story map.

## Wrap Up

Stories help us learn about ourselves and the world. Keep reading and exploring new adventures!
